# Infinite Improbability Drive

This is a port of a game i made about 5 years Ago.
It was the simplest and primitiv kind of a game i could imagine this time. I also made this to get into Lua/Löve2D

Game:
There is not much to say about, you play the blue "thing" and have to catch the other "things". 
The box will give you a bonus (could be positiv or negativ).
Everytime you catch an object you will get some points.
It is a arcade game so the goal ist to get so highest highscore.


I don't know if the filesystem is implemented in LövePotion yet, i cant get it to work. If anyone could tell me how to use it, i will do an update so the highscore get's saved.

To play the game just put everything in a folder and on your SD card.
